##原文：
现在由我来分享我的假期故事。大家或许很难相信，现在还有人不会骑自行车。但，我就是其中一个。我知道这也许听起来很惊奇，但它是真的。但入学后，我发现我必须学会骑自行车，因为学校太大了。刚开始，我上车不过3s便会仓皇下车。对平衡的把握对我来说是一大难点。于是我便去请教我的朋友，在几个小时的训练后，我掌握了一部分窍门，已经可以骑行相当一段距离了。

It's time to share my story in holiday now. Everyone may be hardly to believe that anyone can't ride bike now. But, i am. I know it is heard amazing, but it's really.After school opened, i found i must study it, because the university it's too big.At first, i can ride only 3s. Understanding balance is too hard for me, so that i ask my friend for some help. After 3hours of training, i can ride more better than ever.
It's a good experience
